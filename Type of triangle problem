#TYPE OF TRIANGLE 
#DESCRIPTION: You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size 3 which can form the sides of a triangle. A triangle is called equilateral if it has all sides of equal length. A triangle is called isosceles if it has exactly two sides of equal length. A triangle is called scalene if all its sides are of different lengths. Return a string representing the type of triangle that can be formed or "none" if it cannot form a triangle.
#My code is only for the 2 cases that I needed to do in order to be accepted. 

class Solution(object):
    def triangleType(self, nums):
        for number in enumerate(nums): #going through each number in the array
            if nums[0] and nums[1] == nums[2]: #condition if all sides of triangle are equal
                return("equilateral")
        calc1= nums[0] + nums[1] #calculates the sum of two sides of the triangle
        calc2= nums[1] + nums [2] 
        calc3= nums [0] + nums[2] 
        if calc1 > nums[2] and calc2 > nums[0] and calc3 > nums[1]: #condition if the sum of 2 sides are greater than the third side for all three cases
            return("scalene")
        else:
            return("none")
